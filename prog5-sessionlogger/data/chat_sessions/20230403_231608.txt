Scabies is not an infection, but an infestation. Tiny mites called Sarcoptes scabiei set up shop in the outer layers of human skin. The skin does not take kindly to the invasion. As the mites burrow and lay eggs inside the skin, the infestation leads to relentless itching and an angry rash.

Children are often more likely to get scabies. For babies and very young children scabies is often found on the head, face, neck, palms, and soles of the feet.
For people who have never had scabies before, symptoms usually take 4-6 weeks to appear. Symptoms appear more quickly in people who have had scabies before, in as few as 1 to 4 days. Scabies mites can spread to other parts of the body and from one person to another person even before symptoms start.
The same mite that causes scabies also causes crusted scabies. Crusted scabies is severe scabies that happens in people who have weakened immune systems. People with crusted scabies are infested with very large numbers of mites. This increases their risk of spreading mites to others, either from brief skin-to-skin contact or from contact with items such as bedding, clothing, furniture, rugs, and carpeting.
