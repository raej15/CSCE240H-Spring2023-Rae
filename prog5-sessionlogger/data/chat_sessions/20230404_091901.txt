There is no vaccine or medicine to prevent scabies. Effective medicine to treat scabies is only available with a doctor's prescription.
Travelers can avoid scabies by not touching or having close skin-to-skin contact with a person who has a rash or who is itching. Avoid touching or handling a sick personâ€™s clothing or bedding.
Scabies mites die when you wash bedding and clothing using hot water and hot dryer cycles or dry-clean the items. Items that cannot be dry-cleaned or laundered can be disinfested by storing them in a closed plastic bag for more than 72 hours. Scabies mites generally do not survive more than 2 to 3 days away from human skin.
